# PGM

This is a toy project for handling Probabilistic Graphical Models. For now, it is a work in progress. Only simple
Bayesian Networks are supported right now, with quite restrictive hypotheses, but the goal is to provide a flexible
command line interface for handling Bayesian Networks.

It relies heavily on pandas and numpy.
